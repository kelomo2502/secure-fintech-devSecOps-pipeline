### Prepare a Security Checklist

üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist for FinTech Applications:
üîê Application Security

- Enforce MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)
- Implement secure session management
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs (prevent injection attacks)
- Use secure password policies and hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt)
- Protect APIs with rate limiting, authentication, and input validation
- Ensure client-side code does not expose secrets or sensitive logic

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit (AES-256, TLS 1.2+)
- Tokenize or mask data where full access isn't required
- Secure storage of credentials and tokens (e.g., secrets manager, vault)

üõ†Ô∏è **Infrastructure and DevOps**

- Use Infrastructure as Code with security scanning (Checkov, tfsec)

- Continuously scan containers and images for vulnerabilities

- Use role-based access control (RBAC) across systems

- Regularly patch systems and dependencies

üìà **Monitoring and Incident Response**

- Monitor access logs and flag suspicious activity
- Configure alerting for critical failures or breaches
- Maintain an incident response plan (IRP)
- Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments

‚öñÔ∏è Compliance and Governance

- Ensure GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and relevant compliance is built into DevOps pipelines
- Automate compliance checks where possible
- Maintain audit logs and secure them appropriately
- Conduct regular security training for staff

## üß± Epic: Setting Up the Development Environment

*This epic focuses on preparing cloud infrastructure, version control, and CI/CD pipeline by leveraging AWS, Amazon EKS, GitHub, and GitHub Actions.*

- Create and configure a secure and ready-to-use AWS account for deploying Kubernetes workloads (Amazon EKS).
- ‚úÖ Checklist:

  - Create AWS Account
  - Visit aws.amazon.com and create a new account (if one doesn‚Äôt already exist).
  - Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) on the root user.
  - Create IAM User for CLI Access
  - Create an IAM user with programmatic access.
  - Assign AdministratorAccess (or use fine-grained permissions for production).
  - Generate and securely store the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
  - Install & Configure AWS CLI
    - Install: brew install awscli or download from AWS site.
    - Configure:`aws configure`
    - Enter the access key, secret key, region (e.g., us-east-1), and output format (json).
    - Set Up Billing Alerts: Enable billing alerts via AWS Budgets to avoid unexpected costs.

## Initialize Local Development Environment

### Set up your machine with the tools and configuration required for cloud-native Kubernetes development and deployment

‚úÖ Checklist:

#### Install Required Tools

- AWS CLI
- kubectl (Kubernetes CLI): `brew install kubectl`
- eksctl (EKS Cluster provisioning tool):

```bash
brew tap weaveworks/tap
brew install weaveworks/tap/eksctl

```

- helm (Kubernetes package manager): `brew install helm`
- git
- Docker (for building images)
- kubectx/kubens (optional tools for switching between clusters/namespaces)
- Terraform (if IaC is involved)
  
#### Authenticate AWS CLI

`aws sts get-caller-identity`

#### Set Up Kubernetes Context (Once EKS is created)

`aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name your-cluster-name`

#### Test Environment

```bash
kubectl get nodes
helm version
eksctl version

```

## Set Up GitHub Repository

### üéØ Goal

#### Create and initialize a GitHub repository for storing application and infrastructure code

`gh repo create secure-fintech-devSecOps-pipeline --public`

### Clone and Set Up Project Locall

`git clone git@github.com:githhub-name/secure-fintech-devSecOps-pipeline --public`

### Initialize Directory Structure

Root_folder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kubernetes/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ helm/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fintech-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

#### Add CI/CD Workflow File

- Example: .github/workflows/deploy.yml should include:

- Add:
  - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  - DOCKER_USERNAME / DOCKER_PASSWORD (if using DockerHub)
  - EKS_CLUSTER_NAME
  - AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME IAM Role ARN for GitHub OIDC (if using)
  - REGION
